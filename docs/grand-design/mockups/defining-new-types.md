# Defining New Types

```
> place new: Struct at: .Foo
```

```
// By the way, (Construct for: Type) is being invoked here as a part of [place]
> construct type: Type with: ()

// Because there is missing data for the [cons], [place] will try and get it 
// as a part of its implementation. Based on its specification, [cons Type] 
// will need additional information.

// Struct needs a few parameters: 
> name1: expr1
> name2: expr2
>
