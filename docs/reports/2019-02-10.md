# State of Parsing

- Shock, right now, uses Nom as its parser framework.
    - Nom has relatively weak support by default for very informative errors.
    Every time something goes wrong, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where
    things went wrong because it only returns the exact combinator rule 
    that caused the problem. This is annoying, as we won't be able to tell 
    the associated `named!` rule that is causing the problem.
  
# State of Eval

- Evaluation in Shock is currently handled in a recursive evaluation model.
    - From my past experience, this is a poor model because it is not robust 
    to control flow jumps, which makes things frustrating when you want to 
    implement, say `call/cc` or exceptions. Now, given that I want to 
    implement delimited continuations in some sort of `shift/reduce` or 
    associated form to get "resumeable exceptions," this is a bad idea.
        - **ACTION: Migrate away from recursive evaluation model.**

# State of Inbuilt Types

- Currently, Shock supports integers, floats, strings, character, as well as 
paths. It also supports procedures, as well as blocks. It also supports 
identifiers in the form of "names."
    - I want to think about introducing **places** as well as **PlaceId** as 
    a primitive type. 
    - **Scopes** should also become a primitive type as maps. They should be 
    expandable as well.
    - **References** and **possessions** should also be considered as 
    first-class types.
    - The ability to define user types should also be allowed. **Usertype** 
    might be a good name for this.
    - **Macros** need to also be implemented as simple in-out procedures over
    types or values.
    
# Achievements

- Shock current supports lexical scope as well as variable definition with 
arithmetic. 
- The current parsing architecture does work, and is sufficient for testing. 
I do not have any wishes to go further with this until it is decided that 
Shock must become more stable and robust to user error (or we can get to the 
bootstraping period, although this requires a lot more work.)
- The REPL library is sufficient and supports history. The command-based 
architecture does at least work, in concept, for a basic language.
- I've gained much more experience with Rust, so this is better.

# Failures

- Shock can't support conditionals because its evaluation model is not good 
enough to allow for functions that affect the VM state. We should change the 
VM API such that it is more flexible to change and that arguments do not get 
evaluated until the command is looked up.
- The current Shock architecture cannot be cleanly mutated into the actual 
desired Shock design. I will need to redesign this and create an entirely 
separate Shock that is a refactor of this version.

# Ideas for Plans

Here's what the large-scale project structure should look like:

- **AlphaDesign:** Refactor towards design
- **AlphaInterpreter:** Create a basic interpreter implementation for Shock.
- **MetalMetaprog:** Metaprogramming support hardening
- **GUIFramework:** GUI + framework w/ SDL 2
- **UserExp:** Error-hardening/UX
- (slack time)
- **LLVM:** Integration with LLVM + native compilation
- **Bootstrap:** Boot-strapping into Shock
- **FinalStretch:** Shock 1.0

# Next Action

- AlphaDesign:
    - Redesign Shock and its APIs to meet the use cases and ideas.
        - Finish the use cases, whittle them down.
        - Translate use cases into API capabilities
        - Come up with all of the APIs to cover capabilities.
        - Come up with tests to illustrate success.
    - Partition work into sprints
    - Complete each sprint.
        - Check for integration with Shock.
        - Do work.
